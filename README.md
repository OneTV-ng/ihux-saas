# Drizzle Studio Usage

To visualize and manage your database schema and relationships, use Drizzle Studio:

```
npm run db:studio
```

or

```
yarn db:studio
```

This will open Drizzle Studio, where you can see all tables, columns, and relationships visually. Make sure your schema files are up to date and exported in your Drizzle config.
